                   <p>I have always been passionate about fitness from a young age! Not only the exercise part of things but also the science behind what you need to do, and what nutrients you need to put into your body to get maximum results. I believe if you are going to achieve your goals it has got to be sustainable, fun and kept fresh. I have worked with a range of people from athletes, academy footballers , children and people who have never been in a gym before. I take pride in every client I train and ensure they can all reach their own maximum potential. I truly believe that exercise changes lives for the better and I hope to keep achieving amazing results with my clients using my knowledge, advice and tailored fitness plans.</p>

                    <p>I started CG Fitness in 2013 at Feel Good Leeds Health club. Since starting, I have trained various clients, helping them to achieve their goals and transform not only their body, but more importantly their lives.</p>
                    <p>I have always been driven to keep fit and been dedicated to my training from a young age. I played for Moortown RUFC from the age of 13 right up to my senior rugby days in which I gained various awards including a selection for Yorkshire at different age groups.</p>
                    <p>I attended Allerton High School and during this time I captained both the rugby and football teams. This helped me to improve my leadership skills and encouraged me to motivate my peers. After sixth form at Allerton High I went on to work at Feel Good Health in Leeds and later became the supervisor. However, I knew all along that I really wanted to fulfil my ambition of becoming a full time personal trainer.</p>
                    <p>I qualified through Babcock International and I am also Kettlbell , TRX , Boxercise and Nutrition qualified. I am always looking to continue my development to benefit not only myself but my clients too. I am always working towards my next goals and look forward to adding more to my list of qualifications and successful testimonials.</p>
