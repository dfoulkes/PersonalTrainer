                   <p>I have always been passionate about fitness from a young age! Not only the exercise part of things but also the science behind what you need to do, and what nutrients you need to put into your body to get maximum results. I believe if you are going to achieve your goals it has got to be sustainable, fun and kept fresh. I have worked with a range of people from athletes, academy footballers , children and people who have never been in a gym before. I take pride in every client I train and ensure they can all reach their own maximum potential. I truly believe that exercise changes lives for the better and I hope to keep achieving amazing results with my clients using my knowledge, advice and tailored fitness plans.</p>

                    <p>Callum set up CG Fitness in 2013 at Feel Good Health Club, Leeds. Since starting, Callum has
                        trained various clients helping them to achieve their own individual goals and to transform not
                        only their bodies, but more importantly their lives. </p>
                    <p>He has always been passionate about fitness from a young age. Not only in relation to exercise,
                        but also learning about the nutrients the body requires to get maximum results when
                        training. </p>
                    <p>Through his career he has worked with a range of people from athletes, academy footballers,
                        children and first time gym users. From those clients who want to achieve a big weight loss to
                        those who want to tone up on a more short-term basis, he is capable of meeting clientâ€™s
                        individual needs and making plans that will best be suited for them. </p>
                    <p>Callum captained both his school rugby and football team which helped him to build leadership
                        skills and encouraged him to motivate others. He played for Moortown RUFC from a young age
                        throughout his school life, where he was selected for Yorkshire at many different ages. </p>
                    <p>After sixth form he went on to work at Feel Good Health Club in Leeds where he later fulfilled
                        his ambition of becoming a full time personal trainer. After qualifying as a personal trainer
                        through Babcock International.</p>
                    <p>He is also qualified in spinning, kettlebell, TRX, Boxercise and Nutrition. He is always looking
                        to continue his development through different courses to benefit his clients. His qualifications
                        and successful testimonials are always growing. </p>
                    <p>As his clients would testify, he offers constant support to all of his clients, outside of their
                        training sessions as well as during these sessions. His ability to motivate his clients is
                        evident through their success.</p>

                    <p>Your sessions are not just about doing the exercise, but are also a chance to be educated on how
                        to change your mind-set and carry these changes throughout your life. If I can make just one
                        positive change in your new journey I will be happy. Whatever your fitness goals are, one thing
