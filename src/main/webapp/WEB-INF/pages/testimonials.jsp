        <p class="lead">I started training with Callum in February 2016 with the aim of putting on some size as doing this on my own was not going as successful as I expected. After 4 days a week for 4 weeks I put on half a stone along with reducing body fat. Callum created me a customised diet plan which was effective around my work schedule and easy to maintain.  After the 4 weeks transformation with Callum I felt more motivated and knowledgeable to progress in preparation for my summer holiday .</p>
