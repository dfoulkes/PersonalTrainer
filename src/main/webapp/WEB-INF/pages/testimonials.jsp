        <p class="lead">I am an ex Manchester City Academy football player, and I approached Callum to improve my
            fitness for my upcoming football season. After training four times a week with Callum I saw my fitness
            improve rapidly. Callum always mixed things up to help me see great results.</p>

        <p class="lead">I started training with Callum in February 2016 with the aim to put on some size as doing this
            on my own was not successful. After training four days a week for four weeks I put on half a stone along
            with reducing body fat. Callum created a customised diet plan for me, which was effective around my work
            schedule and easy to maintain. After the 4 week transformation with Callum I felt more motivated and
            knowledgeable to progress in preparation for my summer holiday.</p>

            <p class="lead">I trained with Callum for over two years. I began working with him originally to lose weight
                and
                beginning at 15 stone 4 pounds I had quite a bit to lose as a size 18.</p>
            <p class="lead">Id re-joined the gym about six months before and only managed to lose a few pounds and I
                really didn't
                know what I was doing or where to go next. I lost more than five stone, 73 pounds (33.11kg) in 23 months
                and Callum had me measure my body fat which I reduced from 39% to 17%! </p>
            <p class="lead">My whole body shape completely changed and everything about me is healthier. With his
                continued guidance
                and motivation I managed to lose a further 12 pounds and reduce body fat. </p>
            <p class="lead">He's done so much to build my confidence (a work in progress) and myself belief. I have lost
                a tremendous
                amount of weight with Callum's help and he has helped to not only change my body shape and given me bags
                more confidence but my fitness levels have soared too.</p>

            <p class="lead">When I started training with Callum I was 5.5 stone heavier than I was now.  I though I was never going to be able to get to my goal weight or get through a PT session.  I was so nervous on my first session I nearly did not turn up i did not have the attitude to think i could get through this never mind go into a gym.  Less than five minuets into my session Callum made me feel totally at ease, walking through each exercise that we were going to do and showing me how to do them. </p><p class="lead">Callum has a very professional attitude but you can also have a laugh while training, he's always on hand when I text with questions or need to know anything about my training.  After loosing 5.5 stone I continue to train with Callum every week I love the gym now and love to learn how to change my body and diet its all about positive mental attitude.</p>

        <p class="lead">I could not have asked for a better PT! I initially contacted Callum with the plan to train with
            him for few months before my wedding. However, I continued to work with him for well over a year because I
            saw great improvements and enjoyed it so much. Every single workout was different and pushed me much further
            than I thought was possible (never knew I was capable of producing so much sweat). I have left so much
            fitter and stronger than before I started,my shape has changed,and I actually don't mind doing burpees! </p>
        <p class="lead">Callum is personable, extremely patient ( I complained ALOT ), motivating, and is evidently
            passionate about what he does. He doesn't take himself too seriously which makes the sessions much more fun.
            No question was ever too silly, and he always went above and beyond to make sure I stayed on track and had
            my own training programmes to complete. I enjoyed every single session and always left in a great mood and
            feeling stronger than ever. I couldn't recommend him more and I know he will continue to have a successful
            career.</p>
