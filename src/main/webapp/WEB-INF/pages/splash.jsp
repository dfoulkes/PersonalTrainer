        <h2 class="featurette-heading">CG Boxing</h2>
        <p class="lead">In December 2015 I wanted to challenge myself in something completely new ... I signed up for a
            UWCB boxing match. When training for my fight I learnt just how much mentally and physically stronger boxing
            made me. During my 5 months of training I decided to improve my knowledge of the sport further by becoming
            boxercise qualified for both adults and children.</p>
        <p class="lead">Nobody can really say they are looking forward to the cardio part of their workout but with
            boxing it is completely different! It is a great total body workout and with such a high intensity you will
            be sure to hit peak anaerobic training territory. This means you will quickly melt away those unwanted
            calories and fat. Boxing doesn't only help improve your body composition but it also focuses on your
            strength , health and getting rid of any stress!! Why not challenge yourself like me in one of the CG
            Boxercise classes or a one to one session?</p>
