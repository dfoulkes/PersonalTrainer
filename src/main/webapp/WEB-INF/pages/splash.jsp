        <p class="lead">Boxing has always been a passion of mine and recently I took part in a charity boxing match.
            When training for my fight I learnt just how much stronger mentally and physically boxing made me.</p>
        <p class="lead">Nobody can really say they are looking forward to the cardio part of their work out but with
            boxing is a total body workout and will enhance your cardiovascular health along with toning and sculpting
            your body. With such a high intensity work out you will be sure to hit peak anaerobic training territory
            meaning you melt away those unwanted calories and fat.</p>
        <p class="lead">Boxing focuses on your upper body strength but also makes you stronger. Boxing is something that
            you can incorporate into your daily workouts. Boxing is a never ending fitness challenge so why not give it
            a go.</p>
